## 🎯 Tips for Writing Effective Natural Language RFP Inputs

### Include These Key Elements:

1. **Quantity/Scope**: How many items, users, or what size
2. **Requirements**: Specific technical or functional needs
3. **Budget**: Approximate budget or budget range
4. **Timeline**: When you need it delivered or implemented
5. **Additional Services**: Installation, training, support, warranties
6. **Special Considerations**: Integration needs, compliance requirements, preferences

### Good Example Structure:
```
[What you need] + [Quantity] + [Key requirements] + [Budget] + [Timeline] + [Additional services needed]
```

### Things to Avoid:
- ❌ Too vague: "I need some computers"
- ❌ Too short: "Buy laptops"
- ❌ Missing critical info: "Need 50 laptops" (no specs, budget, or timeline)

### Best Practices:
- ✅ Be specific but not overly technical
- ✅ Include budget ranges to get realistic proposals
- ✅ Mention deadlines and urgency level
- ✅ State any must-have vs nice-to-have requirements
- ✅ Include support and warranty expectations
- ✅ Mention integration or compatibility needs
